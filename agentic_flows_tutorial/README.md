# Tutorial: Building Agentic Flows in Python

This tutorial series explores concepts and practical examples for building agentic flows and systems in Python. We will cover various architectural patterns and tools that are essential for creating applications that can perform complex, multi-step tasks, maintain state, and interact with their environment.

## Topics to be Covered:

1.  **State Management & State Machines:**
    *   Understanding the importance of state in agentic systems.
    *   Implementing simple state machines to manage agent behavior and flow.
    *   Persisting state (brief discussion, more in database interactions).

2.  **Control Flow and Orchestration:**
    *   Strategies for defining and executing sequences of actions.
    *   Conceptual overview of workflow engines and rule-based systems.
    *   (Potentially a simple custom orchestrator example).

3.  **Tool Usage and Integration:**
    *   Designing interfaces for agent "tools" (functions, API calls).
    *   Dynamic tool selection and execution based on agent state or input.
    *   Handling tool execution errors and responses.

4.  **Task Queues for Asynchronous Agent Actions (e.g., using Celery with FastAPI):
    *   Offloading long-running tasks to background workers.
    *   Integrating FastAPI with a task queue like Celery for reliable background processing crucial for agent actions.

5.  **Event-Driven Concepts for Agents (e.g., WebSockets in FastAPI):
    *   Enabling agents to react to real-time events.
    *   Using WebSockets for bidirectional communication with agents.

6.  **Structured Data Parsing & Generation (with Pydantic):
    *   Reinforcing the use of Pydantic for defining agent inputs, outputs, and tool schemas.

7.  **Logging and Monitoring Agentic Flows:**
    *   Best practices for logging agent decisions, state transitions, and tool interactions.

## Prerequisites:

*   Solid understanding of Python.
*   Familiarity with concepts from the "Advanced Python Concepts" and "Advanced FastAPI Framework" tutorials (or equivalent knowledge).
*   Relevant libraries will be specified per module (e.g., `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `celery`, etc.).

## How to Use This Tutorial:

*   Each topic will have its own Python file with explanations and runnable examples.
*   Follow the instructions in each file to run the examples (e.g., using Uvicorn for FastAPI examples, or specific commands for Celery).
