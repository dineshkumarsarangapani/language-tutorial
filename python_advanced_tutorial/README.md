# Advanced Python Concepts Tutorial

This tutorial covers several advanced Python concepts with examples. Each concept is explained in its own Python file within this directory.

## Tutorial Files:

1.  **`1_generators_and_yield.py`**: 
    *   Explains what generators are and how the `yield` keyword works.
    *   Provides examples of simple generators, a Fibonacci sequence generator, and generator expressions.
    *   Discusses memory efficiency and use cases for generators.

2.  **`2_async_await.py`**: 
    *   Introduces asynchronous programming in Python using `async` and `await`.
    *   Explains coroutines, the event loop, and how `asyncio` helps manage concurrent I/O-bound tasks.
    *   Includes examples simulating API calls to demonstrate concurrent execution versus sequential execution.
    *   Shows usage of `asyncio.create_task()` and `asyncio.gather()`.

3.  **`3_decorators.py`**: 
    *   Explains decorators and how they can be used to modify or enhance functions (acting like interceptors).
    *   Shows the basic structure of a decorator, including the use of `functools.wraps`.
    *   Provides practical examples such as a timing decorator, a decorator that takes arguments, and a class-based decorator.
    *   Highlights benefits like code reusability and readability.

4.  **`4_metaclasses.py`**:
    *   Explains what metaclasses are and how they control class creation.
    *   Shows how to define and use a metaclass to customize classes (e.g., adding attributes, enforcing methods).
    *   Discusses use cases and caveats.

5.  **`5_context_managers.py`**:
    *   Explains context managers and the `with` statement for resource management.
    *   Shows how to create class-based context managers (`__enter__`, `__exit__`) and generator-based ones using `@contextlib.contextmanager`.
    *   Demonstrates error handling within context managers.

6.  **`6_advanced_oop.py`**:
    *   Covers advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts:
        *   **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: Defining interfaces and ensuring subclass implementation using the `abc` module.
        *   **Descriptors**: Customizing attribute access (`__get__`, `__set__`, `__delete__`, `__set_name__`).
        *   **Mixin Classes**: Adding reusable functionality to classes through multiple inheritance.

7.  **`7_concurrency_parallelism.py`**:
    *   Explores concurrency and parallelism beyond basic `asyncio`.
    *   Demonstrates `threading` for I/O-bound tasks and `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks.
    *   Introduces `concurrent.futures` (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, `ProcessPoolExecutor`) as a high-level interface.
    *   Briefly explains the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

8.  **`8_error_handling_logging.py`**:
    *   Focuses on robust error handling and logging strategies.
    *   Shows how to create custom exception hierarchies for more specific error management.
    *   Provides a comprehensive example of using the `logging` module (loggers, handlers, formatters, levels).

9.  **`9_type_hinting.py`**:
    *   Introduces type hinting for static analysis and improved code clarity.
    *   Covers basic type hints, using the `typing` module (List, Dict, Union, Optional, Callable, Any, ClassVar, Generics), and type hinting in classes.

10. **`10_testing_strategies.py`**:
    *   Explains the importance of automated testing.
    *   Demonstrates writing unit tests using the `unittest` module (`TestCase`, assertions, `setUp`, `tearDown`).
    *   Covers mocking dependencies using `unittest.mock` (`Mock`, `patch`, `MagicMock`) to isolate code under test.

11. **`11_design_patterns.py`**:
    *   Introduces the concept of design patterns.
    *   Provides examples of two common patterns:
        *   **Factory Pattern**: Decoupling object creation from client code.
        *   **Singleton Pattern**: Ensuring a class has only one instance and a global access point (implemented with a metaclass and a decorator).

## How to Use This Tutorial:

*   **Read the explanations**: Each Python file contains comments explaining the concepts before the code examples.
*   **Run the examples**: You can execute each Python file directly from your terminal to see the output and how the code works.
    Navigate to the `python_advanced_tutorial` directory and run, for example:
    ```bash
    python 1_generators_and_yield.py
    python 4_metaclasses.py
    # ... and so on for other files
    python 11_design_patterns.py
    ```
*   **Experiment**: Modify the examples or create your own based on what you learn to solidify your understanding.

We hope this tutorial helps you grasp these advanced Python features!
