# Advanced FastAPI Framework Tutorial

This tutorial explores advanced features and best practices for building robust and scalable applications with FastAPI.

We will cover topics such as:

*   Advanced Dependencies (e.g., using `yield` for setup/teardown)
*   Background Tasks
*   Custom Middleware
*   Testing FastAPI Applications
*   Advanced Parameter Declaration (e.g., `Annotated`)
*   Structuring Larger Applications (Routers)
*   WebSockets
*   Security Features (e.g., OAuth2)
*   Interacting with Databases Asynchronously

Each topic will be covered in its own Python file within this directory, with explanations and runnable examples.

## Prerequisites:

*   Basic understanding of Python and its syntax.
*   Familiarity with the fundamentals of FastAPI (routing, request/response handling, Pydantic models).
*   FastAPI and Uvicorn installed (`pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]`).

## How to Use This Tutorial:

*   Read the explanations in each Python file.
*   Run the examples using Uvicorn. For a file named `main_topic.py` containing a FastAPI app instance named `app`:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main_topic:app --reload
    ```
*   Access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI at `/docs` or ReDoc at `/redoc`) in your browser.
*   Experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
