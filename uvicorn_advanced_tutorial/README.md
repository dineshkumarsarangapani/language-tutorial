# Advanced Uvicorn Tutorial

This tutorial explores advanced configuration, usage patterns, and deployment considerations for the Uvicorn ASGI server.

## Topics to be Covered:

1.  **Deep Dive into Configuration:**
    *   Comprehensive command-line options.
    *   Using environment variables for configuration.
    *   Programmatic Uvicorn server setup and execution from Python.

2.  **Worker Management & Process Models:**
    *   Understanding Uvicorn's standard workers.
    *   Running Uvicorn with Gunicorn as a process manager for more robust multi-worker deployments.
    *   Reloading mechanisms (`--reload`, `--reload-dir`, watchfiles).
    *   **Note on Workers and CPUs:** Understanding how worker processes relate to CPU cores is crucial for performance. Multiple workers allow your application to utilize multiple CPU cores, especially important for CPU-bound tasks due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). For I/O-bound asynchronous applications, each worker can handle high concurrency, but multiple workers still offer parallelism for CPU-intensive parts of requests and provide process-level resilience. The optimal number of workers (often starting around `(2 * CPU_cores) + 1` for Gunicorn, or `CPU_cores` for highly async Uvicorn apps) depends on the application's nature and requires testing.

3.  **HTTPS/SSL and HTTP/2:**
    *   Configuring SSL directly with Uvicorn (`--ssl-keyfile`, `--ssl-certfile`, etc.).
    *   Considerations for HTTP/2 support.
    *   (Brief mention of using reverse proxies like Nginx for SSL termination in production).

4.  **Logging and Monitoring with Uvicorn:**
    *   Customizing access log formats.
    *   Configuring log levels for Uvicorn and application logs.
    *   Understanding Uvicorn's error logging.

5.  **Programmatic Control & ASGI Lifespan:**
    *   Running Uvicorn programmatically from your Python code using `uvicorn.run()` and `uvicorn.Server`.
    *   How Uvicorn handles ASGI lifespan events (`startup`, `shutdown`) defined in your application (e.g., in FastAPI).

6.  **Advanced Features & Edge Cases (Conceptual):**
    *   Using `--loop` (e.g., `uvloop`, `asyncio`).
    *   Understanding `--http` (e.g., `httptools`, `h11`).
    *   WebSockets proxying considerations (if applicable).
    *   Unix domain sockets and file descriptor passing.

## Prerequisites:

*   Basic understanding of ASGI and how web servers like Uvicorn work.
*   Familiarity with running Python applications (e.g., FastAPI, Starlette, Django 3+).
*   Python installed.
*   Uvicorn installed (`pip install uvicorn` or `pip install uvicorn[standard]` for uvloop and httptools).

## How to Use This Tutorial:

*   Each topic will generally be explained with command-line examples, configuration snippets, or Python code where applicable.
*   Some examples will require a simple ASGI application (e.g., a basic FastAPI app) to demonstrate Uvicorn's behavior.
