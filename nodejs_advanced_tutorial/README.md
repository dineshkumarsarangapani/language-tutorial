# Advanced Node.js & TypeScript Tutorial

This tutorial delves into advanced concepts, patterns, and best practices for building robust, scalable, and efficient applications using Node.js and TypeScript.

## Topics to be Covered:

1.  **Modern Asynchronous JavaScript & TypeScript:**
    *   Callbacks (briefly, to understand their evolution).
    *   Promises: Chaining, `Promise.all()`, `Promise.allSettled()`, `Promise.race()`, `Promise.any()`.
    *   `async/await`: Clean asynchronous code, error handling with `try...catch`.

2.  **The Node.js Event Loop, Non-Blocking I/O & Concurrency Model:**
    *   In-depth explanation of the event loop phases.
    *   How Node.js achieves concurrency without traditional multi-threading for user code.
    *   Understanding `libuv` and its role.
    *   Implications for writing high-performance applications.

3.  **Streams in Node.js:**
    *   Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams.
    *   The `pipe()` method for efficient data processing.
    *   Handling backpressure.
    *   Practical examples (e.g., file processing, HTTP requests/responses).

4.  **Modules, Packages & Project Structure:**
    *   CommonJS (`require`) vs. ES Modules (`import/export`) in Node.js and TypeScript.
    *   Configuring TypeScript for different module systems (`tsconfig.json`).
    *   Best practices for structuring larger Node.js/TypeScript projects.
    *   Effective use of `npm`/`yarn` and `package.json`/`package-lock.json`.

5.  **Advanced Error Handling Strategies:**
    *   Creating and using custom Error classes.
    *   Consistent error propagation in synchronous and asynchronous code.
    *   Handling unhandled promise rejections and uncaught exceptions.
    *   Operational errors vs. programmer errors.

6.  **Testing Node.js & TypeScript Applications (e.g., with Jest or Mocha/Chai):**
    *   Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing concepts.
    *   Mocking/stubbing dependencies (modules, APIs).
    *   Testing asynchronous code effectively.
    *   Code coverage.

7.  **Child Processes in Node.js:**
    *   `child_process` module: `spawn()`, `exec()`, `execFile()`, `fork()`.
    *   Communicating with child processes (stdio, IPC).
    *   Use cases: Offloading CPU-bound tasks, running external scripts/binaries.

8.  **Advanced TypeScript Features:**
    *   Generics: Creating reusable, type-safe components.
    *   Decorators: Metaprogramming for classes and members (conceptual, especially relevant with frameworks like NestJS).
    *   Advanced Types: Conditional types, mapped types, template literal types, utility types (`Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.).
    *   Type Guards and Narrowing.
    *   Using `interface` vs. `type` effectively.

9.  **Performance Optimization & Profiling in Node.js:**
    *   Identifying performance bottlenecks (CPU, memory).
    *   Using Node.js built-in profiler (`--prof`) and Chrome DevTools.
    *   Memory leak detection and management.
    *   Caching strategies.

10. **Security Best Practices in Node.js Applications:**
    *   Common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection (if applicable), CSRF, etc.) and how they relate to Node.js.
    *   Input validation and sanitization.
    *   Managing dependencies and security updates (`npm audit`).
    *   Securely handling secrets and environment variables.

## Prerequisites:

*   Solid understanding of JavaScript (ES6+ features).
*   Basic to intermediate knowledge of TypeScript.
*   Familiarity with Node.js fundamentals (creating a server, basic I/O).
*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
*   TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) installed globally or as a project dependency.

## How to Use This Tutorial:

*   Each topic will have its own `.ts` (TypeScript) file with explanations and runnable code examples.
*   Code will typically be compiled using `tsc` and run with `node`.
*   Specific setup instructions (e.g., `npm install` for dependencies) will be provided where necessary.
